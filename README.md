The objective of Zomato data analysis could be to gain insights into the restaurant landscape based on the data provided by Zomato. Some possible objectives could include:

1. Understanding the distribution of restaurants across different cities and countries.
2. Analyzing the relationship between ratings, votes, and restaurant names.
3. Determining average ratings and average costs for two people across different restaurants.

The findings of the analysis could include:

1. Total number of restaurants in each city and country.
2. Sum of votes grouped by rating text (e.g., excellent, very good, good, etc.).
3. Restaurant names along with their average ratings.
4. Average cost for two people at each restaurant.

By conducting this analysis, one can gain insights into the popularity, pricing, and quality of restaurants within the Zomato dataset, helping users make informed decisions about dining options.
